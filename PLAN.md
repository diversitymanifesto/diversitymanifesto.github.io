Leaders in D&I

# Buy in

Who should invest time into helping with this? Any organiation which is serious about D&I and who claims to be "socially responsible".

Content generated through this initiative may be presented at future tech conferences.  Solving D&I shortcomings internally is fantastic, working with partners and competitors to solve these issues across
an industry is awesome.

Everyone welcome. Ideally we build a diverse, cross function group of 10 - 12 individuals who will help with the final draft. 

# Add useful resources to page

Similar to awesome docs. Links to whitepapers, studies, D&I content from other orgs such as Uber, Facebook and Twitter.

# 3 basic components of the manifesto

## Beliefs

"I believe ..."

## Goals

"I want to ..."

## Wisdom

“I know this to be true...” 

These can be things you’ve learned from your own experience, wisdom passed down from your family, or even inspirational quotes.


# Dont's

Get caught up in semantics.
Lose interest. 
Repeat #hack-harassment failings.
