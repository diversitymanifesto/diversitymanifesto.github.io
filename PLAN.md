- Meetings with those in the games industry
- Leaders in D&I

# Form Alliance

Ask studios, individuals. groups to sign up to this effort publically.  Use this to spread the word.

# Buy In

Who should invest time into helping with this? Any organization which is serious about D&I and who claims to be "socially responsible".

Content generated through this initiative may be presented at future tech conferences.  Solving D&I shortcomings internally is fantastic, working with partners and competitors to solve these issues across an industry is being "socially responsible".

Everyone welcome. Ideally we build a diverse, cross functional group of 10 - 12 individuals who will help with the final draft.

# 3 Basic Components Of The Manifesto

## Beliefs

"I believe ..."

* Everyone has a right to a workplace that does not discriminate
* An inclusive and tolerant workplace provides a better and more productive environment for people in that workplace
* A diverse workplace helps people find a wider range of solutions to problems

## Goals

I want to ...

* Work in an industry that treats all people fairly
* Work with people who bring a broad range of ideas to the table

## Wisdom

“I know this to be true...” 

* Personal hat
  * Working with people who treat their colleagues with respect makes for a better, more productive workplace
  * Working with people who don't respect others damages motivation and makes it harder for me to do my job well

* Organisational hat
  * The games industry (like the tech industry) **needs** skilled engineers and artists. 
  * Excluding candidates based on their gender, sexual preference, religion, skin colour, place of birth, or any other label makes it harder to recruit
  * Tolerating exclusionary behaviour (i.e. assholes'  behaviour) drives non-assholes out of your organisation and stifles problem-solving and creativity
  * Rather than assessing candidates to ensure they fit into your culture, try to determine if candidates have traits that make them harder to work with 


# Dont's

Get caught up in semantics.
Lose interest. 
Repeat #hack-harassment failings.
